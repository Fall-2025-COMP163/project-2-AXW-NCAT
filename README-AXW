AI Assistance:
For this project, AI mainly helped me fix bugs. For example, I used AI to fix the methods of attack and take damage inside the Character class. 
I also used AI to help me with the correct syntax when using the super function to refer to a parent class. I was writing super without the parentheses, which, to Python, made it seem like it was its own class when it wasn't. Instead, I had to add the parentheses to make it a function.

How to test my code:
To test my code, you will create the variables char1 and char2. For those variables, you will assign each a Character Class, such as Warrior, Rogue, or Mage, and give your hero a name.
After those variables are established, you will put those variables into the SimpleBattle class as arguments. Then, to see the battle occur, you will type out the fight method using dot notation.
Ex. This is what a test run could look like:
char1 = Rogue("Lewis")
char2 = Mage("Gandalf")

SimpleBattle(char1, char2).fight()

Bonus Creative Feature:
I added 2 more character classes to the mix. I added a class called Alein and one called Musique.
The differences among these character classes are their attack methods. For example, the Alien has laser eyes as a standard attack. For the Alien's super attack, this character can set his opponents on fire, dealing lots of damage.
For the Musique character, he has musical powers. His standard attack is firing a bunch of notes at his opponent. His special attack is titled "Petal" because in music, a petal tone is a really low note that is very loud and powerful.
